Basic Recipe website based on html. 

Things learned - basic elements, attributes, working with git, HTML boilerplate
Learned while making the project - multiline typing in vscode 
(end of the line - alt + shift + t)
(start of the line - alt + shift + t + home key )
absolute links vs relative links

Moving back to root directory when html file is in other directory 
ex - ../img/misosoup.jpg
